Ping Pong Code Review DMiller and Epicodus HTML CSS JavaScript
Framework (https://DianaRMiller.github.io/pingpongcode)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to Diana Miller's JavaScript Code Review! This is an html, css and
JavaScript framework where the user is prompt to enter a number and the page
has to display a list of numbers. The page will print "ping" for multiples of
3 and "pong" for multiples of 5. In addition it will print "ping pong" for both
multiples of 3 and 5. Sounds exciting! It's both fun and challenging.
Here are some of the features my project provides for you:

* It shows how JavaScript works with a Ping pong demo
* Use of loops, conditionals and variables
* Interaction with user
* Practicing and perfecting the use of html, css and JavaScript
* FYI: Site under construction: please be patient!

Files in pingpongcode review
----------------------------------------------------------------

The framework has a few files you should check out.

* stylesheet.css
  This is the main file of the style of the page. This is what makes
  the page look nice!

* bootstrap.css
  This file sets more styles into your html.

* scripts.js
  This file sets up the interaction between you and the page to create a ping pong interaction
  between the user and the html page. It prompts the user to enter a number and the page has to
  display every number from a list up to a certain number.
  The page will print "ping" for multiples of 3, "pong" for multiples of 5 and "ping-pong" for
  both multiples of 3 and 5.

* README.md
  This file tells you more about my project, what programs I used and how to interact with it.
  Have fun!
